## Context
The underwriter case record to be summarized is stored in the cat_perils table. The record contains information about various locations, policy level coverages, location level coverages, building level coverages, risks, and case suggestions.

## Instructions
1. Extract the individual locations and und buildings under each location from the cat_perils table associated with the FSO case record '  {{fso_underwriting_case}}'
2. Identify the policy level coverages, including limits, deductibles, and premiums for each coverage type.
3. Identify the location level coverages, including limits, deductibles, and premiums for each coverage type.
4. Identify the building level coverages, including location details, limits, deductibles, and premiums for each coverage type.
5. Extract the risks associated with each location.
6. Summarize the case suggestion and any changes in the limits or deductibles for all coverage types.
7. Do not show the section number. just the section name.

## Output
The output should be a summary of the underwriter case record in the following format:

First section:
- Individual locations and und buildings under each location.

Second section:
- Policy level coverages with limits, deductibles, and premiums for each coverage type.

Third section:
- Location level coverages with limits, deductibles, and premiums for each coverage type.

Fourth section:
- Building level coverages with location details, limits, deductibles, and premiums for each coverage type.

Fifth section:
- Risks associated with each location.

Sixth section:
- Summary for the case suggestion and change in the limits or deductibles for all coverage types.

The summary should be concise, typically no more than a few sentences long, and should focus on the most important information. It should not include unnecessary details or redundant information.
